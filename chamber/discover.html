            <p class="discoverp">Wickham Park was originally founded by Peter Wickham and his family in 1640.  Peter was a wealthy adventurer who wanted to try his luck in the "New World".  After finding his way to what would be called Wickham Park, decided to 
                make it his home after discovering that the land provided everything that they needed to thrive.  Peter Wickham opened up the first General Store, the first Post Office, and the first School.  He helped others in the community to set up businesses that were needed by donating to them.
                These and other early businesses did so well that they are still being run today!  Before his passing, Peter was quoted with one final thought on the town: "While Wickham Park is beautiful, the true treasure is found in its people.  We support eachother here and have built eachother up to what it is now.  We are our greatest asset!"
